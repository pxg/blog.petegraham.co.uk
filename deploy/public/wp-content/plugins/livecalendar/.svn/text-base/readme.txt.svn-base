Customization Instructions
==========================

      Calendar Spinner:

      Three different calendar update spinner styles are included with LiveCalendar.
      If you want to use a spinner other than the default, simply change to the desired
      alternate wait(x).gif in the configuration area inside livecalendar.php.

      Spinner gif files were created to be easily tinted or colorized by an image
      editor that can create animated gif files. Set the image pallete to RGB, use a
      20px paintbrush set to "screen" mode, select the color you want the darkest part
      to be, and proceed to use the paintbrush to recolor each frame, and re-export the
      animated gif. Darker or richer colors work better than pale or pastel colors. The
      unused link color in your css stylesheet usually looks best.

      Weekday Name Format:

      Settings can be changed on how the days of the week are displayed on the calendar.
      To change the style, just select the desired display format in the configuration
      area in livecalendar.php

      Start of Week:

      The first day of the week can now be controlled via the WordPress admin settings.
      See 'Weeks in the calendar should start on...' at wp-admin/options-general.php

      Permalink Format:

      Appropriate permalinks are now automatically taken from wordpress's rewrite
      configuration.


Known Issues
============

      Formatting of previous and next year links in navigation no longer adhere to
      Wordpress calendar CSS stylesheet naming scheme and can no longer use the month
      formatting. New entries for "prev_year" and "next_year" will need to be created
      in your CSS file.
